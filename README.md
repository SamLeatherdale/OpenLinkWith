## What is Open Link With: Redux?

Welcome to Open Link With: Redux!

This is the revived version of the [original Open Link With app](https://github.com/tasomaniac/openlinkwith), which was created by Said Tahsin Dane. 

Unfortunately, the app was no longer maintained by the original developer, as it does not target the latest Android SDK. 
On August 31, 2024, [Google required all apps to target at least Android 13](https://developer.android.com/google/play/requirements/target-sdk), or they would be removed from the Play Store, including Open Link With.

So, I decided to fork the app, upgrade it to the latest SDK, and re-publish it on the Play Store.

Below, you can find the original README.

## What does it do?

Open the current webpage in a browser in another app!

Did it ever happen to you? You click a link (let's say Youtube link) and the system does not ask you anything and opens the link in the browser. And you are stuck in Youtube webview instead of watching the video in the native app.

There are 2 options for you. You either watch the video in the web or you remember the name of the video and search it in the app. Well, not anymore. 

With OpenLinkWith, you can share any webpage with it and it will ask you which applications to open the link with.

Although the original intent of the application is to direct webpages to apps, it can even be used to switch between apps. Imagine you have 2 Twitter clients in your phone. You can open a tweet in the official Twitter application and then switch to an another app with the same tweet opened. Cool, hah?

## Why

Although the problem discovered above is not huge, it is missing in the Android ecosystem. And I couldn't find anything doing this. So I wrote one. :)

Although it is not the most useful app, it does save you when you stuck in a browser where you want the native app to be open. I hope you find it useful.


## Translation

The original app's translation project is still live at https://crowdin.com/project/open-link-with/

However, I have not yet set up the translation project for this fork.
